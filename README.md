# Todo List Web-based Application 

Basic todo list created to practice AJAX and UI design strategies. AJAX allows pages to update asynchronously by updating a page without reloading the entire page. Responsive designs have a single layout that changes when browser resized. Dynamic serving designs have targeted content per device served, but doesn't adapt to broswer window size and requires maintaining multiple layouts.

This todo list tracks items by category and marks when they have been completed at the touch of a button.
